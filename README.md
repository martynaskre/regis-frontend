Regis
=============

Regis is a web application that helps customers make appointments with
desired professionals. The project plan will include a scope statement,
a milestone schedule, team member roles. The project will be overseen by
Vilnius University professor Marius Liutvinavičius and managed by team
leader Tomas Jonauskas.

Description
-----------

The purpose of Regis is to make scheduling appointments easier for both
customers and professionals. This web application will provide an
easy-to-use calendar tool, which will show customers on which date a
professional is a free while at the same time giving them the ability to
sign-up for sessions. Furthermore, with the same tool, experts will be
able to check their appointment status, manage their schedules, cancel
or create sessions, which will, in turn, help them make the most out of
their time. Moreover, each visitor will be given a chance to create a
personal profile, where they will be able to view all of their personal
data.
